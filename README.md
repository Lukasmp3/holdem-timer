# Holdem Timer

Timer/clocks for Texas Holdem Poker.

This project is my first JS app. The aim is to get familiarized with the JS environment.  

On the first page, the user configur the new session. The second (main) page contains timer, where the user can manually stop/pause the clocks and is notified by sound (if configured) when the game limits change.
